          Before building a commercial gym, it is important to define exactly what a commercial gym is and 
          if this is the type of gym you want to build. A commercial gym is a public gym equipment for most people.
           These are generally large spaces used by customers or members and intended for physical activity. 
           Training at a commercial gym is attractive because it offers a wide variety of exercise equipment,
            programs, and services that you may not have access to at home. A commercial gym, on the other hand, 
            is the place where you can achieve your fitness goals. These fitness studios are usually equipped with 
            durable professional fitness equipment that is designed for intensive use. Commercial gyms are also known for their various workout programs and classes and sometimes other amenities such as showers, lockers, saunas, massage chairs, swimming pools, basketball courts, etc.</p>
